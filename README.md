Hello world!

This is the start of LeonorPDX's coding journey on GitHub. LeonorPDX is an emerging full-stack web developer based out of Portland, OR, USA. When not tapping on keys and talking to rubber ducks, LeonorPDX enjoys hiking the mountains of the Pacific Northwest, sipping on good whiskeys, and serenading an indifferent cat named Kitten accompanied by the dulcet(-ish) tones of their mediocre ukulele skills.
